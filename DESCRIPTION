Title: Mixture modeling of single-cell RNA-seq data to indentify genes
        with differential distributions
Description: This package implements a method to analyze single-cell RNA-
    seq Data utilizing flexible Dirichlet Process mixture models. Genes with
    differential distributions of expression are classified into 
    several interesting
    patterns of differences between two conditions. The package also includes
    functions for simulating data with these patterns from negative binomial
    distributions.
